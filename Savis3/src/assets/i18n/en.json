SAVIS is an educational tool to help to intuitively understand concepts of tests of statistical hypotheses and confidence intervals using visualizations based on resampling and randomization techniques. SAVIS has an online and a stand-alone version (both freely available) in English and Spanish.",
    "about_created": "SAVIS was created in the Spring of 2019 and extended in the Spring of 2020 and Spring of 2024 by the following graduating seniors from the Department of Computer Science at CSUS under the direction of Rafael E.
