# One Proportion Confidence Interval
This feature helps in estimating a range where the true population proportion lies based on a sample proportion. Here, we take in success and failure and show the proportion of success and the calculation involves the sample size with a chosen level of confidence (eg., 95%). We are able to see mean, standard deviation, lower and upper bounds of the intervals. 



# Timeline

# Testing 
### Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
